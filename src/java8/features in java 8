- ***Day One
- INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS, PROGRAMS, AND JAVA

- RAM (Random Access Memory) is referred to as "random access" because it allows data to be read and written in any order,
  rather than sequentially.
- The application program interface (API), also known as library, contains predefined
  classes and interfaces for developing Java programs.

- We have Syntax error, runtime Error, Logical Error
- Logic errors occur when a program does not perform the way it was intended to.

- *** Day 2
- our mission is to solve problems by writing programs.
- Identifiers are the names that identify the elements such as classes, methods, and
  variables in a program.
- An identifier is a sequence of characters that consists of letters, digits, underscores
  (_), and dollar signs ($).
- inner classes and anonymous will use $ in the compiled files.

- An expression represents a computation involving values, variables, and operators that,
  taking them together, evaluates to a value.
