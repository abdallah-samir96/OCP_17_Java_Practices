- RAM (Random Access Memory) is referred to as "random access" because it allows data to be read and written in any order,
  rather than sequentially.
- The application program interface (API), also known as library, contains predefined
  classes and interfaces for developing Java programs.

- We have Syntax error, runtime Error, Logical Error
- Logic errors occur when a program does not perform the way it was intended to.
