Encoding:  transforms data into another format using a scheme that is publicly available so that it can easily be reversed.
It does not require a key as the only thing required to decode it is the algorithm that was used to encode it.
Examples: ASCII, Unicode, URL Encoding, Base64

Encryption: The purpose of encryption is to transform data in order to keep it secret from others
using algorithms like (AES, Blowfish, RSA)


Hashing:  serves the purpose of ensuring integrity,
making it so that if something is changed you can know that it’s changed.
- fixed-length string.
- not reversable



Obfuscation:
The purpose of obfuscation is to make something harder to understand,
usually for the purposes of making it more difficult to attack or to copy.

One common use is the the obfuscation of source code so that it’s harder
to replicate a given product if it is reverse engineered.
